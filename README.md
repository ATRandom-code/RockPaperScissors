# RockPaperScissors

To use this code, you can simply call the rock_paper_scissors function with the player's choice as an input. The function will return the result of the game as a string. For example, if you run rock_paper_scissors("rock"), the output will be "It's a tie!" if the computer also chooses rock, "You win!" if the computer chooses scissors, and "Computer wins!" if the computer chooses paper.

Let me know if you have any questions.
